Project Overview
Objective:
Develop a web-based platform—“WhatsApp Housing Aggregator”—that:
Integrates with WhatsApp: Automatically joins pre-approved WhatsApp groups focused on housing (sublets, apartments, rentals).
Extracts and Processes Data: Collects and parses messages to identify key information such as property details, prices, locations, and contact information.
Displays Listings: Presents the processed data in a user-friendly interface, enabling prospective tenants and landlords to search and interact with listings.
Target Audience:
Landlords or individuals offering properties for sublet/rental.
Potential tenants searching for housing options in Germany.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 WhatsApp Integration
Automated Group Joining:
The system must support a secure mechanism to join designated WhatsApp groups.
Ensure proper authentication and compliance with WhatsApp’s policies.
Message Retrieval:
Periodically fetch new messages from these groups (e.g., every 5–10 minutes).
Handle multimedia content (images, links) alongside text.
2.2 Data Extraction & Processing
Parsing and Extraction:
Develop algorithms to extract key fields from messages such as:
Property type (apartment, room, house, etc.)
Rental price and currency
Location (city, neighborhood)
Contact details (phone numbers, emails)
Additional details (furnished status, lease duration)
Data Normalization:
Standardize the extracted data (e.g., currency format, location names).
Flag and handle incomplete or ambiguous listings.
Manual Override:
Include an admin interface to review, edit, or correct extracted data.
2.3 Website Display and User Interaction
Listing Interface:
Display listings in a clear, responsive grid or list view.
Each listing should summarize the key details with an option to view more.
Search & Filtering:
Enable users to search by keywords.
Provide filtering options by location, price range, property type, and more.
User Engagement:
Optionally, allow users to register/log in to save favorites, contact landlords, or receive notifications.
Responsive Design:
Ensure the website works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.
2.4 Admin & Moderation Tools
Dashboard:
Provide an administrative dashboard for monitoring new listings, flagging inappropriate content, and manual data corrections.
Spam/Irrelevant Content Management:
Implement tools to detect and filter spam or off-topic messages.
2.5 Data Security & Compliance
Privacy & GDPR Compliance:
Ensure user data and extracted information are handled according to GDPR and local German data protection regulations.
Secure Data Transmission:
Use encryption (HTTPS, secure API calls) when transferring data between WhatsApp, backend, and front-end.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
Website load times should be optimized (target under 3 seconds on standard broadband).
Efficient handling of real-time updates without noticeable delays.
Scalability:
The system should handle an increasing number of listings and concurrent users.
Reliability:
Ensure high uptime and graceful degradation if WhatsApp integration experiences issues.
Usability:
User-friendly interface with clear navigation, inspired by platforms like HousingAnywhere and Wunderfalts.
4. Acceptance Criteria
4.1 WhatsApp Integration
The system successfully authenticates and joins at least one designated WhatsApp group.
New messages are fetched automatically on a defined schedule (e.g., every 10 minutes).
The integration handles failures (e.g., network errors) with appropriate retries and error logging.
4.2 Data Extraction & Processing
Automated parsing correctly extracts key fields (e.g., property type, price, location) from at least 90% of relevant messages.
The system normalizes data into a consistent format.
An admin panel exists for manual review and correction of extracted data.
4.3 Website Display & User Interaction
Listings are displayed clearly, with pagination or infinite scroll for large datasets.
Users can search and filter listings by key parameters (location, price, type).
The website is responsive and performs well across various devices and screen sizes.
User feedback mechanisms (e.g., reporting issues with listings) are in place.
4.4 Admin & Moderation Tools
An admin dashboard is available with functionality to monitor, edit, and flag listings.
The system effectively identifies and isolates spam or irrelevant messages.
4.5 Data Security & Compliance
Data is transmitted securely with encryption.
All data handling processes meet GDPR requirements and include user consent where necessary.
5. Development Checkpoints & Milestones
Phase 1: Planning & Design (Weeks 1-2)
Requirements Gathering: Finalize the detailed requirements with stakeholders.
Design Documentation: Produce system architecture and UI/UX wireframes inspired by existing housing platforms.
Technical Feasibility: Research WhatsApp integration options and compliance considerations.
Phase 2: Prototype Development (Weeks 3-5)
WhatsApp Integration Prototype:
Build a prototype that demonstrates joining a test WhatsApp group and retrieving messages.
Data Parsing Module:
Develop an initial version of the data extraction algorithm and test with sample messages.
Phase 3: Core Development (Weeks 6-10)
Backend Development:
Build the complete WhatsApp integration, data normalization, and storage mechanism.
Frontend Development:
Develop the basic website interface displaying static listings.
Admin Dashboard:
Implement a basic dashboard for data review and management.
Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Weeks 11-13)
End-to-End Integration:
Connect backend data extraction to dynamic front-end display.
Performance & Security Testing:
Conduct load testing, security assessments, and GDPR compliance checks.
User Testing:
Perform beta testing with real users to gather feedback and iterate.
Phase 5: Launch & Post-Launch (Weeks 14-16)
Final Adjustments:
Address any issues from user feedback and testing.
Deployment:
Launch the website on a production environment.
Monitoring & Support:
Set up monitoring tools and plan for ongoing support and updates.
6. Additional Considerations
Legal and Ethical:
Verify the legal implications of scraping and processing WhatsApp data. Obtain necessary permissions and ensure transparency with users.
Fallback Strategies:
Develop manual data entry and moderation options if automated extraction fails or yields inconsistent results.
Scalability Planning:
Architect the system with scalability in mind to support growing user numbers and additional WhatsApp groups in the future.
Maintenance & Updates:
Plan for regular system updates and bug fixes, with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices in place.
